My Data Science projects

Welcome to my portfolio. My name is Ory Schneor, a data scientist and analyst. Through the portfolio you'll be able to learn about my analytical skills, my modelling abilities, statistical knowledge and programming and visualizations skills.

In addition, you can find 2 additional projects I was working on and submitted to the DataCamp competitions:

1. https://app.datacamp.com/workspace/w/c5487c20-b507-49f5-93ee-6cdc380d0315 - A/B Test results - Which version of a website would you choose?
2. https://app.datacamp.com/workspace/w/1eafdb65-2830-489c-934a-99bb579b526a - Reducing the employee turnover rate in a company

I'll be happy to answer any question you might have.

Yours,

Ory Schneor
